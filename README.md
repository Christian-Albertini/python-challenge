UNC Module 3 Challenge

I used Geeksforgeeks.com to find a function to pull a specific value from a csv file, which I used in Pybank to get the month for the greatest increase and decrease based on having the index.
I used Stack overflow to find a way to check for if something isn't in a dictionary, and if it isn't then to add it in PyPoll.
I used Stack overflow to find the right way to use the max function to get the winner in PyPoll.
I used Stack Overflow to find the keys and values functions that pull just those values from a dictionary in PyPoll.
